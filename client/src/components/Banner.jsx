          I’m passionate about tech, the environment, my hobbies and art. I’ve
          been instrumental in building a web design agency from the ground up
          but I’m seeking a new challenge. I’ve had diverse life experience as a
          former professional baseball player, a group fitness coach and a
          commercial actor. I’m a root cause full circle communicator,
          team-oriented energy giver and a creative problem solver. I’m eager to
          take the next step in my software development career utilizing my
          previous work experience, leadership and teamwork abilities.
